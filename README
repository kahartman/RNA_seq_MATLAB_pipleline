RNA-seq pipeline for importing and anaylzying .fastq files in MATLAB
  written by Graham Heimberg -- Graham.Heimberg@ucsf.edu

Functions:

set_pipeline_params:
   input arguments:
      1. NONE
   values returned:
      1. parameters - struct containing relevant information to many different functions
   Desicription:
      Often called first in a pipeline. User's are expected to modify specified parameters and directory locations inside to point to their own data. The returned struct is frequently passed to and modifed by functions throughout the pipeline. 
   Example:
      params = set_pipeline_params();


runbowtie2:
   input arguements:
      1. file_index - the index of a fastq file in a list of fastq filenames in paramater struct 
      2. parameters - parameter struct returned by set_pipeline_params
   values returned:
      1. paramters - returns a modified parameters to include information about the alignment (sam filenames)
   Description:
      Wrapper for calling bowtie2 within matlab. The function call to the command line is constructed within this function. It obtains its bowtie function call parameters from the parameters struct.
   Example:
      for file_ind = 1:numel(params.fastq_files)
         params = runbowtie2(file_ind, params);
      end
