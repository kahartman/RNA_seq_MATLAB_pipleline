RNA-seq pipeline for importing and anaylzying .fastq files in MATLAB
  written by Graham Heimberg -- Graham.Heimberg@ucsf.edu

Functions:

set_pipeline_params:
   Input arguments:
      1. NONE
   Values returned:
      1. parameters - struct containing relevant information to many different functions
   Desicription:
      Often called first in a pipeline. User's are expected to modify specified parameters and directory locations inside to point to their own data. The returned struct is frequently passed to and modifed by functions throughout the pipeline. 
   Example:
      % initialize params struct
      params = set_pipeline_params();


runbowtie2:
   Input arguements:
      1. file_index - the index of a fastq file in a list of fastq filenames in paramater struct 
      2. parameters - parameter struct returned by set_pipeline_params
   Values returned:
      1. paramters - returns a modified parameters to include information about the alignment (sam filenames)
   Description:
      Wrapper for calling bowtie2 within matlab. The function call to the command line is constructed within this function. It obtains its bowtie function call parameters from the parameters struct.
   Example:
      % run bowtie2 on each file in the list of fastq files
      for file_ind = 1:numel(params.fastq_files)
         params = runbowtie2(file_ind, params);
      end

sam_gene_align:


convert_bam:

   Description:
      Wrapper call to samtools to convert between Sam and Bam formats. If sam file is passed in, the function converts it to bam. If a bam file is passed in it converts it to a sam file.
   Input arguments:
      file_in - sam/bam file to convert, include extension
      file_out - sam/bam file to convert to, include extension
   Example:
      % convert my.bam to my.sam
      convert_bam('/path/my.bam', '/path/my.sam');
